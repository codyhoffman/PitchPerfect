# PitchPerfect iOS App

An iOS app that records a users voice, then directs you to a screen with 
6 options for altering the recorded voice in different pitches and frequencies,
then plays it back to the user. As of 12/21/16, the only known bug is with the UI
when used on an iPhone with a smaller screen like an iPhone 5, the stop button on the
record screen gets cut off a bit. Otherwise, it is working with all other types of 
iOS devices.

This is the second iOS app I've written, it took me roughly 10 hours across a span
of three days to complete this project. I found myself hung up on getting the UI to look
nicely using StackView, I slept on it and revisted. I managed to figure it out fairly quickly
on the second attempt. Although it is very basic, I learned a lot about using Xcode, swift
syntax, and how to format the UI using Constraints, AutoLayout, and StackView. I also learned 
how delegation and Outlets/Actions work inside of Xcode.
