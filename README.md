# PitchPerfect iOS App

An iOS app that records a users voice, then directs you to a screen with 
6 options for altering the recorded voice in different pitches and frequencies,
then plays it back to the user. This is the second iOS app I've written, it took me roughly 10 hours across a span
of three days to complete this project. I found myself hung up on getting the UI to look
nicely using StackView, I slept on it and revisted. I managed to figure it out fairly quickly
on the second attempt. Although it is very basic, I learned a lot about using Xcode, swift
syntax, and how to format the UI using Constraints, AutoLayout, and StackView. I also learned 
how delegation and Outlets/Actions work inside of Xcode.
